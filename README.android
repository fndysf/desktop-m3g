Platform specific problem
-------------------------------------------
  Desktop-M3G for Andorid doesn't support libjpeg yet.
  Please use only PNG format.
 

-------------------------------------------
Make & Install
-------------------------------------------

  = libpng.so =
    Unfortunately, Android-SDK does not include libpng.so.
    So you need to compile it by yourself.
    Julienr's customized version is easy to use (https://github.com/julienr/libpng-android).

    1. git clone http://github.com/julienr/libpng-android.git
    2. cd libpng-android
    3. ./build.sh
           - will generate libpng.so 
    4. Copy *.h and libpng.so to following directory.
        - ${Desktop-M3G}/src/external/include
        - ${Desktop-M3G}/src/external/lib/android  (for Android)

  = libm3g-reader-write.a =
    libm3g-reader-write.a is a simple library for reading/writing m3g file format.
    Because Desktop-M3G does not include this, you need to download and compile it 
    and copy proper files before compiling Desktop-M3G.
    
    1 Compile libm3g-reader-writer.a
        - http://code.google.com/p/m3g-reader-writer
        - see README
    2. Copy *.hpp and libm3g-reader-writer.so to following directory.
         - ${Desktop-M3G}/src/external/include/m3g/
         - ${Desktop-M3G}/src/external/lib/android  (for Android)

  = libm3g.so =
    You need ndk-build (http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html)

      1. cd build/android      (for Android)
      2. ndk-build
           - will generate Desktop-M3G

    You can configure some options by changing build/android/include/m3g/Config.hpp
    (Default is good, I suppose you don't need to change this)

Test & Samples
-------------------------------------------

  = UnitTest =
    Sorry, There are no unit tests under Android OS.
    It is a big problem.

  = Samples =
    Sorry, There are no samples under Android OS(NDK).
    Java-M3G has samples for Android OS(Java)

       - See http://code.google.com/p/java-m3g/
