Brief description
-------------------------------------------
  
  = What is Desktop-M3G? =
    Desktop-M3G is free C++ implmentation of M3G-1.1 (JSR-184) API.
    It is distributed under MIT liscence.
    Current version of Desktop-M3G is only for Linux.
    I recommend Ubuntu 9.04. It's same as My PC.

  = Requirement =
    - OpenGL 1.5 or higher
    - libpng, libjpeg, libz

    Desktop-M3G does not have any Window creation or OpenGL context.
    You need glut or any other library (SDL, Qt, ...)

  = Wat is ruby-m3g? =
    It's ruby binder of Desktop-M3G.
    You can use Desktop-M3G from Ruby!
    If you are not interesting in ruby, ignore this.

-------------------------------------------
Make & Install
-------------------------------------------


  = libm3g =
    1. change to src directroy.
    2. make
    3. make install

  = ruby-m3g = 
    1. change to src/ruby-m3g/directory.
    2. ruby extconf.rb
    3. make
    4. make site-install


-------------------------------------------
Test & Samples
-------------------------------------------
  = UnitTest =
    You need UnitTest++(http://unittest-cpp.sourceforge.net/).
    1. change to test
    2. make
    3. ./a.out

  = Samples =
    You can find about 20 samples at samples directory.
    These are good entry points learning how to use Desktop-M3G.
    1. change to sample/test-xxx
    2. make
    3. ./a.out
