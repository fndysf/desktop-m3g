Brief description
-------------------------------------------
  
  = What is the Desktop-M3G? =
    Desktop-M3G is a free C++ implementation of M3G-1.1 (JSR-184) API.
    It is distributed under MIT license.
    Current version of Desktop-M3G works on only Linux.
    I recommend Ubuntu 10.10. It's same as My PC.

  = Requirement =
    - OpenGL 1.5 or higher
    - libpng, libjpeg, libz, libm3g-reader-writer
    Desktop-M3G does not have any method for creating a window and OpenGL context.
    You need glut or any other libraries (SDL, Qt, ...)


-------------------------------------------
Make & Install
-------------------------------------------

  = libm3g.so =
    You need cmake (http://www.cmake.org/).

      1. cd build/Debug
      2. cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug ../..
           - Makefile will be generated.
      3. make
      4. make install
           - install Desktop-M3G to ${Desktop-M3G}/bin.

    You must call cmake under build directory. Don't call it at top directory.
    Currently, default build target is "Debug" and install under ${Desktop-M3G}/bin.
    If you want to install it in your system with "Release" build,


      1'. cd build/Release
      2'. cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Relese ../..
      3'. make
      4'. sudo make install
           - install Desktop-M3G to /usr/local/include and /usr/local/lib.



-------------------------------------------
Test & Samples
-------------------------------------------
  = UnitTest =
    You need UnitTest++(http://unittest-cpp.sourceforge.net/).
    1. cd test
    2. make depend
    3. make 
    4. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../bin/lib
    5. ./a.out

  = Samples =
    You can find about 15 samples on samples directory.
    These are good entry points for learning how to use Desktop-M3G.
    1. cd sample/sample-xxx-yyy
    2. make depend
    3. make
    4. export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../bin/lib
    5. ./a.out
