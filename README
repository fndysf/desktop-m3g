Brief description
-------------------------------------------
  
  = What is Desktop-M3G? =
    Desktop-M3G is free C++ implmentation of M3G-1.1 (JSR-184) API.
    It is distributed under MIT liscence.
    Current version of Desktop-M3G works on only Linux.
    I recommend Ubuntu 10.04. It's same as My PC.

  = Requirement =
    - OpenGL 1.5 or higher
    - libpng, libjpeg, libz
    Desktop-M3G does not have any method for creating a window or OpenGL context.
    You need glut or any other library (SDL, Qt, ...)


-------------------------------------------
Make & Install
-------------------------------------------

  = libm3g.so =
    You need cmake (http://www.cmake.org/)
    1. cd build
    2. cmake ..
         - make file will be generated.
    3. make
    4  make install
         - install Desktop-M3G to ${Desktop-M3G}/bin.
    You must call cmake under build directory. Don't call it under top directory.
    Currently, default build target is "Debug" and local install.
    It will be installed under ${Desktop-M3G}/bin.
    If you want to install in your system (DANGER!!),
    3. cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
    

-------------------------------------------
Test & Samples
-------------------------------------------
  = UnitTest =
    You need UnitTest++(http://unittest-cpp.sourceforge.net/).
    1. move to test directory
    2. make depend
    3. make 
    4. ./a.out

  = Samples =
    You can find about 20 samples at samples directory.
    These are good entry points learning how to use Desktop-M3G.
    1. move to sample/test-xxx directory
    2. make depend
    3. make
    4. ./a.out
